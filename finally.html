Not much to say, except thanks.
<br><br>
This is not me being nice when I say you're very high on the list of the best people I know.
<br><br>
So thank you for being so nice and supportive with everything.
<br><br>
Thanks for all the music you recommend.<br>My taste is pretty top notch I know, but your recommendations actually do improve it.<br>I appreciate that.
<br><br>
Thank you for listening to my ramblings about the stories.<br>Really appreciate how much interest you show in them, would have dropped it pretty long ago otherwise.
<br><br>
Also for your interest in berserk, though I haven't told plot for months,<br>uh sorry for that, but really is great that you actually listen to me about that.
<br><br>
Thank you for showing your art, and your animations, and the comics.<br>I really do love them, have to, they're all so damn good,<br>appreciate so much that you show them.
<br><br>
Also, thanks for telling all the stuff about your stories. They are all so good, I can't believe how you think of all the characters.<br> Gerishi will always be pure wholesome, Ryan will always be pure joy.<br>Kim is mean yes, but he's super cool. Nova and Connor ehâ€¦sorry kidding, they are really cool too.<br>Can't name them all but my boy Zetsu, Hugo, Ann, Kia, Klaus, Winry, William, Evan, Adam, and Adam again, and literally all of them are so cool.<br>I love hearing about them, thank you for that.
<br><br>
And of course, all the stuff you did.<br>The animations on my birthday, the edits you made,<br>the kid ger animation <3, the pfp, and stickers of course, love them all so so much.<br>I appreciate it all beyond words, can't thank you enough.<br>But I'll still try, so thank you.
<br><br>
But even without all the stuff, you're such a great friend.<br>So just thank you for that. I'm glad you're a friend, your friends are lucky.<br>Thanks for being around.
<br><br>
And yeah that's it, hope you have the best day ever, and the best year ever.<br>Conquer anything and everything, my Liege, sidekick is very proud of you.
