	<h1>So I did a thing</h1>
	<h4>
	<br>Yeah, I tried something. I played the same simple tune I played last year.<br>
	<br>And I butchered some other stuff too yayy
	<br>Anyway, it's still basic things, but even if I ended up ruining the songs, it made me improve.<br>So yeah, thank you for that too, you actually do bring out the good in people :)
	<br><br>And my deepest apologies for ruining your songs :]
